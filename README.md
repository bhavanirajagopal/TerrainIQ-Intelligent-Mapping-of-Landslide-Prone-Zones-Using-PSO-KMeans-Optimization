Landslide Risk Prediction Using Image Segmentation and Geospatial Analysis
Overview
This project presents a data-driven framework for predicting and mapping landslide-prone areas using a combination of remote sensing imagery, machine learning, and geospatial analytics.
The system integrates K-Means clustering with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to improve the precision of soil segmentation and cluster stability. It then computes a weighted landslide risk index using parameters such as soil fragility, slope, rainfall, and vegetation cover.
The framework was developed to analyze terrain vulnerability in the Western Ghats, providing insights that support disaster risk management and sustainable land-use planning.
Features
•	Remote sensing data preprocessing from open-source satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel).
•	Unsupervised image segmentation using K-Means and PSO optimization.
•	Multi-parameter landslide risk modeling combining geophysical and climatic factors.
•	GeoJSON-based mapping for GIS visualization of vulnerable zones.
•	Model evaluation using internal clustering metrics and classification metrics.
•	Scalable and modular architecture, suitable for regional or real-time applications.

Methodology
1. Image Preprocessing and Feature Extraction
•	Satellite imagery is imported, corrected, and normalized.
•	Key features extracted include:
o	NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
o	Slope and Elevation
o	Land Use / Land Cover (LULC)
o	Soil Type and Moisture
2. Clustering and Optimization
•	K-Means clustering segments terrain features into K clusters based on pixel similarity.
•	Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) optimizes initial centroids to avoid local minima and improve convergence.
3. Landslide Risk Calculation
A weighted risk formula combines soil fragility, slope gradient, rainfall, and vegetation coverage:
R = w1Sf + w2Sl + w3Rf + w4Vc
where Sf, Sl, Rf, and Vc denote normalized values for soil, slope, rainfall, and vegetation.
4. Visualization and Validation
•	Clustered outputs are visualized using GeoJSON overlays in GIS tools.
•	High-risk zones correspond with regions of steep slopes, deforestation, and heavy rainfall.
